# Changelog Generator

A simple tool to automate changelog generation during release process.

## Usage

Go to your project git folder and run the script.

```bash
cd ~/my-project

npx github:10up/changelog-generator 
```

The script will:
- Read all closed PRs within a milestone
- Search for "Changelog" section in the PR description, take all records from it. Use PR title by default if no "Changelog" section found
- Read all events from the PR and form participants list. Add participants as "props" to the entry.
- Add link to the PR (via ...) to the end of entry.
- Check if one of known prefixes is applied to the changelog entry (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)
- If no prefix given, but @dependabot is in the list of participants, consider this is a "Secutiry" update, otherwise set "Other" prefix.

## Command-line Arguments

### --milestone, -m
(Required) Specify the name of target milestone to extract changelog entries from.

### --pat, -p
(Optional) GitHub personal access token. Default is `empty`

### --repo
(Optional) Custom GitHub repository address. Default is `empty`, use repository from the current folder.

### --style, -s
(Optional) Output style
- `grouped` Group changelog entries (Added, Fixed, etc.)
- `plain` (default) plain list of changelog entries

### --quiet
(Optional) Disable debug output, only the resulting changelog will be printed.

## Example with Simple Podcasting

Let's create a changelog for the [release version 1.2.3](https://github.com/10up/simple-podcasting/milestone/11?closed=1)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:10up/simple-podcasting.git

cd simple-podcasting
